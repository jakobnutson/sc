  abstract={The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely.}

  note={CVPR Oral Presentation},
  abstract={Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions.}

  note={Spotlight Presentation},
  abstract={By decomposing the image formation process into a sequential application of denoising autoencoders, diffusion models (DMs) achieve state-of-the-art synthesis results on image data and beyond. Additionally, their formulation allows for a guiding mechanism to control the image generation process without retraining.}

  abstract={Vision Transformers (ViT) typically require massive datasets to outperform CNNs. We propose a novel regularization technique and architecture modification that allows ViTs to train effectively on small datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, Flowers-102) from scratch, achieving state-of-the-art performance.}
